Project Summary
The Peer Feedback App is designed to enhance student’s work and collaboration by
facilitating structured, anonymous, and constructive peer feedback. The app supports students
by allowing them to provide and receive feedback on various performance criteria, encouraging
accountability.

## Problem Statement
Students often hesitate to seek help due to stigma, cost, or accessibility barriers. Peer feedback provides a low-cost, supportive way to encourage improvement, but traditional methods lack structure and anonymity. This app addresses those challenges.

## Solution
Our solution provides:
- **Anonymous peer evaluations** on predefined or custom criteria.
- **Self-assessment tools** with growth tracking.
- **Feedback dashboards** for easy review.
- **Notifications & reminders** to ensure timely participation.
- **Data privacy & security** with FERPA/GDPR compliance.

## Objectives
- Enable anonymous peer evaluations.
- Support self-assessment and reflection.
- Ensure a supportive and respectful environment.
- Prioritize data privacy and simple accessibility.

## Branch Naming Guidelines
All branches should follow the naming pattern:
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>

Where '<type> is one of:
- feature
- bugfix
- task
- hotfix

Example:
- 'feature/123-login'
- 'bugfix/23-headerfix'

## React Frontend Development Setup

- **Project location**
  - React app lives at `src/frontend/react-app`

- **Prerequisites**
  - Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (Vite 7 requirement)
  - npm 10+ recommended

- **Install dependencies**
  - In `src/frontend/react-app` run:
    - `npm install`

- **Run the dev server**
  - `npm run dev`
  - Open the printed URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Allow firewall prompts if asked.

- **Build and preview production**
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run preview` (serves the built app locally)

- **Styling**
  - App styles are in `src/frontend/react-app/src/styles.css` (copied from the prototype).
  - Do not edit `src/frontend/prototype/styles.css` for React behavior; keep changes in the React copy.

- **Navigation (key routes)**
  - Auth: `/login`, `/registration`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/logout`
  - Student: `/student-dashboard`, `/give-feedback`, `/my-feedback`, `/self-assessment`, `/feedback-history`
  - Instructor/Admin: `/instructor-dashboard`, `/create-evaluation`, `/manage-courses-groups`, `/aggregated-reports`, `/reports-export`, `/peer-matching`, `/admin-analytics`, `/admin-settings`
  - Shared: `/notifications`, `/profile`, `/privacy-settings`, `/about-help`

- **Role switch for testing**
  - Use the sidebar “View as” select to toggle Student/Instructor menus. Choice persists via `localStorage`.

- **Linting**
  - `npm run lint`

- **Troubleshooting**
  - If the dev server fails with a Node version error (e.g., crypto.hash or Vite requires newer Node), upgrade Node to 20.19+ or 22.12+.
